#  BMI Calculator


## What does this app do:

This is a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the user’s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice. 

## What I’ve learnt while creating this app:

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
